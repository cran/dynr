# README #

This README documents the steps necessary to get `dynr` cooking.  That was the first of many food-based puns.  It will not be the last.

We primarily use a [centralized workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow) in git.  Occasionally, we employ a [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow) style for larger features that may break the master branch for extended periods of time.

Please follow [these basic guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) when writing commit messages.

 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
 1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
 1. Capitalize the subject line
 1. Do not end the subject line with a period
 1. **Use the imperative mood in the subject line**
 1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
 1. Use the body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*

We use [win-builder](https://win-builder.r-project.org/) to help test the repository prior to [submitting a new release to CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html).
