dynr 0.1.11-8
--------------

2017-08-21

New features include:
* Noise printing by plotFormula() function

Bug fixes and performance tweaks include:
* Fixed innovation vector computation for larger than 1-dimensional observations


dynr 0.1.11-2
--------------

2017-06-16

New features include:
* New demo for a linear oscillator with time-varying parameters

Bug fixes and performance tweaks include:
* Fixed printex output for covariates and deviation form of the initial conditions
* Fixed memory leak for intercepts in measurement models


dynr 0.1.10
--------------

2017-05-19

New features include:
* Use of individual-level covariates in the initial conditions. See ?prep.initial for details.
* Deviation form of regime-switching models.  Seee ?prep.regimes for details.
* Access to the predicted, filtered, and smoothed latent variable estimates, and other by-products from the regime-switching extended Kalman filter in the 'cooked' model.
* We now allow calculation of the negative log-likelihood value, the hessian matrix, and the predicted, filtered, and smoothed latent variable estimates at fixed parameter values without parameter optimization.
* Beta version of a multiple imputation procedure.  See ?dynr.mi for details.

Bug fixes and performance tweaks include:
* Fixed a rounding bug that improves free parameter optimization, especially for models with many observed variables.
* Improved documentation throughout
* Added more examples in the help pages


dynr 0.1.9
--------------

2017-02-21

New features include:
* A new demo example is added to replicate the results from Yang & Chow (2010) paper.
* Some standard S3 methods are added for the dynrCook class object.
* autoplot() is added as an alias for dynr.ggplot().
* dynr.data() now automatically handles ts class objects and equally spaced data with missingness.

Bug fixes and performance tweaks include:
* Changes are made to accommodate the new release of ggplot2. 


dynr 0.1.8
--------------

2016-08-12

New features include:
* None


Bug fixes and performance tweaks include:
* In single-regime models, free parameters for intercepts and covariate effects
    in the measurement model can now be properly estimated.
* Standard errors are more frequently returned
* Flags indicate problematic standard errors.
* Warning messages are more helpful regarding standard errors.
* A weight flag allows easier convergence of multi-subject models.
* Several new plotting features.


dynr 0.1.7
--------------

2016-06-07

Initial release to CRAN!
