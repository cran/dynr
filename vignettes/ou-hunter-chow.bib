@book{Hofbauer88a,
	Abstract = {This textbook is an introduction to dynamical systems and its applications to
evolutionary game theory, mathematical ecology, and population genetics. This
first English edition is a translation from the authors' successful German
edition which has already made an enormous impact on the teaching and study of
mathematical biology. the book's main theme is to discuss the solution of
differential equations that arise from examples in evolutionary biology.
Topics covered include the Hardy-Weinberg law, the Lotka-Volterra equations
for ecological models, genetic evolution, aspects of sociobiology, and
mutation and recombination. There are numerous examples and exercises
throughout and the reader is led up to some of the most recent developments in
the field. Thus the book will make an ideal introduction to the subject for
graduate students in mathematics and biology coming to the subject for the
first time. Research workers in evolutionary theory will also find much of
interest here in the application of powerful mathematical techniques to the
subject.},

	Abstract = {Hypothesizes a 6-stage "scheme of moral development" in an attempt to determine continuities between childhood and adult development. the criterion for development are: (1) "changes in the general shape, pattern, or organization of response, (2) "newness, a qualitative difference in response," (3) irreversibility, (4) "a pattern of universal stepwise invariant sequences," (5) a hierarchy of functioning, and (6) the "integration of a set of functional contents at the prior stage." It is shown that the way in which value is placed on the concept of human life is the primary difference between each stage. Results indicate that this "sequence is invariant for individuals in the United States" and suggests that it is also culturally universal. It was found that adulthood was characterized by stabilization of early attitudes; the exception of the college sophomore was discussed. Development during adulthood was considered a "movement toward integration in the use of moral structures" and "thought in its application to life."

They do not seem to understand the relationship between times series models and discrete time (stochastic) differential equations, whereas Anderson (1963) does. on page 422 they note how "it is not very satisfying to account for continuity in a process variable at the manifest level simply by relating its current values to its previous values.", but then suggest dealing with latent variables will be more satisfying. to me this echos similar feelings about the inadequacy of time series models with respect to interpretation: they are not inherently dynamically meaningful. However, once the time series models can be interpreted at differential equations, then I think we have something!},

	Abstract = {Multiple time series of scalp electrical potential activity are generated routinely in electroencephalographic (EEG) studies. Such recordings provide important non-invasive data about brain function in human neuropsychiatric disorders. Analyses of EEG traces aim to isolate characteristics of their spatiotemporal dynamics that may be useful in diagnosis, or may improve the understanding of the underlying neurophysiology or may improve treatment through identifying predictors and indicators of clinical outcomes. We discuss the development and application of non-stationary time series models for multiple EEG series generated from individual subjects in a clinical neuropsychiatric setting. the subjects are depressed patients experiencing generalized tonic-clonic seizures elicited by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as antidepressant treatment. Two varieties of models-dynamic latent factor models and dynamic regression models-are introduced and studied. We discuss model motivation and form, and aspects of statistical analysis including parameter identifiability, posterior inference and implementation of these models via Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. in an application to the analysis of a typical set of 19 EEG series recorded during an ECT seizure at different locations over a patient's scalp, these models reveal time-varying features across the series that are strongly related to the placement of the electrodes. We illustrate various model outputs, the exploration of such time-varying spatial structure and its relevance in the ECT study, and in basic EEG research in general.},
